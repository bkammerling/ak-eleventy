          Adam is a former UK poetry slam champion. He began performing poetry
          on the slam scene in Brighton and has been gigging regularly for over
          a decade. From the Helsinki Word Festival to Glastonbury Poetry Stage,
          from Southbank Centre to venues countrywide.


          His forthcoming book, There is a Goldfish, on [Outspoken Press,](http://www.outspokenldn.com/) explores his Jewish heritage and discovers how generational trauma lives in the body and the cathartic potential that exists in contemporary spaces. As a producer and artist with the Chill Pill Collective he sold out shows all over the country and regularly hosted The Big One events at The Albany, Deptford.

          ### Adam and Cuth
          
          Cuth produces beats. Adam raps. Together they make soulful, down to earth hip hop without pretension, misogyny or shiny accessories.
