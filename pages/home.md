        Adam is a former UK poetry slam champion. He began performing poetry on
        the slam scene in Brighton and has been gigging regularly for over a
        decade. From the Helsinki Word Festival to Glastonbury Poetry Stage,
        from Southbank Centre to venues countrywide.


        His forthcoming book, **There is a Goldfish**, on [Outspoken Press,](http://www.outspokenldn.com/) explores his Jewish heritage and discovers how generational trauma lives in the body and the cathartic potential that exists in contemporary spaces. As a producer and artist with the Chill Pill Collective he sold out shows all over the country and regularly hosted The Big One events at The Albany, Deptford.

        A unique and visceral fusion of spoken word and dance. Adam teamed up with dance super- humans, Si Rawlinson and Emma Houston, to explore the effect of hero behaviour on real-world attitudes to violence, and male mental health. Commissioned by Apples And Snakes and the Albany, and supported by Arts Council England, Shall We Take This Outside toured to Bristol, Southampton, Stratford, Canterbury and Norwich, and featured at Southbank Centre for BAM festival.

        ### DIIONN


        A collaboration with producer and filmmaker, Joseph Bird. A meshing of influences from Fugazi to 0800 Dinosaur, from The Cure to Outkast. Equal parts political and playful, bleak and lush. Rerecorded with Sam Miller, mixed by Josh Grey-Jung of Strangelove.

        ### Do You Fruit?


        Weighty themes and bleak aesthetics. The collaboration between Adam and producer Fea explores the interaction of sparse dub with spoken texts. In the vein of King Midas Sound or Kode9 and Space Ape.
