        Adam is a former UK poetry slam champion. He began performing poetry on
        the slam scene in Brighton and has been gigging regularly for over a
        decade. From the Helsinki Word Festival to Glastonbury Poetry Stage,
        from Southbank Centre to venues countrywide.


        His forthcoming book, **Seder**, on [Outspoken Press,](http://www.outspokenldn.com/) explores his Jewish heritage and discovers how generational trauma lives in the body and the cathartic potential that exists in contemporary spaces. As a producer and artist with the Chill Pill Collective he sold out shows all over the country and regularly hosted The Big One events at The Albany, Deptford.

        Cuth produces beats. Adam raps. Together they make soulful, down to earth hip hop without pretension, misogyny or shiny accessories.

        ### DIIONN


        *diion (chemistry)* *n.* *Any ion having two electrical charges*


        A collaboration with producer and filmmaker, Joseph Bird. A meshing of influences from Fugazi to 0800 Dinosaur, from The Cure to Outkast. Equal parts political and playful, bleak and lush. Rerecorded with Sam Miller, mixed by Josh Grey-Jung of Strangelove.

        ### Do You Fruit?


        Weighty themes and bleak aesthetics. The collaboration between Adam and producer Fea explores the interaction of sparse dub with spoken texts. In the vein of King Midas Sound or Kode9 and Space Ape.

        ### Shall We Take This Outside

        </blockquote>


        A unique and visceral fusion of spoken word and dance. Adam teamed up with dance super- humans, Si Rawlinson and Emma Houston, to explore the effect of hero behaviour on real-world attitudes to violence, and male mental health. Commissioned by Apples And Snakes and the Albany, and supported by Arts Council England, Shall We Take This Outside toured to Bristol, Southampton, Stratford, Canterbury and Norwich, and featured at Southbank Centre for BAM festival.

        ### Seder


        *now we are lighting the candles*


        *returning to when our bodies are*


        *asking why is this night different*


        A hyper-dynamic cohort of artists examine intergenerational trauma and the rituals we make for connection and processing. Seder asks how all of us can celebrate our existence, and how, by softening the boundaries of tribal practice, we welcome new bodies into an age-old space.


        Developed over lockdown with dancers Emma Houston, Si Rawlinson and Saskia Horton, and musicians Bellatrix and Antosh Wojcik, Seder is a unique performance that continues the work of the poetry collection of the same name.

        ### Workshops


        Adam has been delivering poetry, rap and spoken-word theatre workshops for over ten years. As his own practice has widened so has his education work; producing poetry books, theatre shows, podcasts and dance pieces. Reaching emerging artists, young people in schools, artists with specific learning needs, and elderly and isolated artists.


        He is the creative producer of The Nest, a project established with the Fostering Network, which delivers creative workshops to young people who are a part of the Mockingbird fostering program.

          <p class="mb-0">*Adam was sensational. His initial performance showed that he had come prepared, with an awesome, inspiring and witty poem, which fitted perfectly with the theme of the day. His humour was a brilliant touch and the students loved him. He clearly knows how to work with young people and get the most out of them - no matter what their ability. He fitted in perfectly with our plans - even ones that we slightly changed. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to another school or to recommend that this artist returns to our school in the future. Thank you.*</p>
